```
You will rebuild the app from scratch with ZERO deployment errors.

STRICT BUILD RULES:
- No external libraries unless guaranteed supported by Mini App Factory.
- No undefined imports, variables, functions, or hooks.
- All state must be initialized with safe defaults.
- All schemas, models, and data structures must be explicitly defined.
- No backend code that requires custom servers or systemctl.
- Use only simple CRUD data operations.
- Use only built-in components for UI.
- Avoid complex calendar libraries. Build a simple grid-based calendar instead.
- All actions must have try/catch and return safe values.
- No deep nested objects.
- Keep code minimal, modular, and deploy-safe.

APP REQUIREMENTS:
Build a “Shared Availability Calendar” app:

1. Users can mark each day as:
   - Free
   - Busy
   - Tentative

2. Users can create a shared calendar group and invite others by shareable link.

3. All members’ availability is merged:
   - Green = All free
   - Yellow = Partially free
   - Red = Conflict

4. The app shows:
   - Calendar view
   - Group availability summary
   - Next available days (sorted)

5. Notifications:
   - When a user updates availability
   - When everyone is free on an upcoming day

6. Data Models (simple JSON):
   User: { id, name }
   Group: { id, name, members: [userId] }
   Availability: { userId, date, status }
   GroupAvailability: { groupId, date, statuses: [status] }

7. Absolutely NO unsupported APIs or server-level code.

DELIVERABLE:
Generate a FULLY DEPLOYABLE Mini App Factory app with:
- correct imports
- correct handlers
- no undefined functions
- simple lightweight calendar
- no deployment errors
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files are the ones that will need to be edited to satisfy the request to generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to change the `title` and `description` values.
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to create the new logo image description.
3. `mini-app/public/logo.png.done` – (if it already exists) to remove or update the existing logo data.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
