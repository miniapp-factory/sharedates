+Code the following app
+```
+You will rebuild the app from scratch with ZERO deployment errors.
+
+STRICT BUILD RULES:
+- No external libraries unless guaranteed supported by Mini App Factory.
+- No undefined imports, variables, functions, or hooks.
+- All state must be initialized with safe defaults.
+- All schemas, models, and data structures must be explicitly defined.
+- No backend code that requires custom servers or systemctl.
+- Use only simple CRUD data operations.
+- Use only built-in components for UI.
+- Avoid complex calendar libraries. Build a simple grid-based calendar instead.
+- All actions must have try/catch and return safe values.
+- No deep nested objects.
+- Keep code minimal, modular, and deploy-safe.
+
+APP REQUIREMENTS:
+Build a “Shared Availability Calendar” app:
+
+1. Users can mark each day as:
+   - Free
+   - Busy
+   - Tentative
+
+2. Users can create a shared calendar group and invite others by shareable link.
+
+3. All members’ availability is merged:
+   - Green = All free
+   - Yellow = Partially free
+   - Red = Conflict
+
+4. The app shows:
+   - Calendar view
+   - Group availability summary
+   - Next available days (sorted)
+
+5. Notifications:
+   - When a user updates availability
+   - When everyone is free on an upcoming day
+
+6. Data Models (simple JSON):
+   User: { id, name }
+   Group: { id, name, members: [userId] }
+   Availability: { userId, date, status }
+   GroupAvailability: { groupId, date, statuses: [status] }
+
+7. Absolutely NO unsupported APIs or server-level code.
+
+DELIVERABLE:
+Generate a FULLY DEPLOYABLE Mini App Factory app with:
+- correct imports
+- correct handlers
+- no undefined functions
+- simple lightweight calendar
+- no deployment errors
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
